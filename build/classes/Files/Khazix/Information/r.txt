Each rank allows Kha'Zix to evolve one of his abilities, giving it a unique additional effect. When activated, Kha'Zix becomes Invisible, triggering Unseen Threat and increasing Movement Speed. If he chooses to Evolve Adaptive Cloaking, while out of combat Kha'Zix also passively gains Void Assault upon entering a new brush.
